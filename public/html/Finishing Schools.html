                        round personality development, cultural and social activities. Specific skill sets may be

                        is intended to complete the educational experience. It may consist of an intensive course, or a
                        one-year program.

                    <div>

                        An individual's personality is an aggregate conglomeration of decisions we've made throughout
                        our lives (Bradshaw). There are inherent natural, genetic, and environmental factors that
                        contribute to the development of our personality. According to process of socialization,
                        "personality also colors our values, beliefs, and expectations ... Hereditary factors that
                        contribute to personality development do so as a result of interactions with the particular
                        social environment in which people live."

                        There are several personality types as Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers illustrated
                        in several personalities typology tests. These tests only provide enlightenment based on the
                        preliminary insight scored according to the answers judged by the parameters of the test. Other
                        theories on personality development are Jean Piaget stages of development, and personality
                        development in Sigmund Freud's theory being formed through the interaction of id, ego, and
                        super-ego

                        A skill is the learned capacity to carry out pre-determined results often with the minimum
                        outlay of time, energy, or both. Skills can often be divided into domain-general and
                        domain-specific skills. For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include
                        time management, teamwork and leadership, self motivation and others, whereas domain-specific
                        skills would be useful only for a certain job. Skill usually requires certain environmental
                        stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.

                        People need a broad range of skills in order to contribute to a modern economy and take their
                        place in the technological society of the twenty-first century. The American Society for
                        Training & Development (ASTD), a non-profit association for workplace learning and performance
                        professionals study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and so are the
                        skills that employees must have to be able to change with it. The study identified 16 basic
                        skills that the workplace of the future would need in the employee of the future.

                        The skills involved can be defined by the organization concerned, or by third party
                        institutions. They are usually defined in terms of a skills framework, also known as a
                        competency framework or skills matrix. This consists of a list of skills, and a grading system,
                        with a definition of what it means to be at particular level for a given skill.
                        To be most useful, skills management needs to be conducted as an ongoing process, with
                        individuals assessing and updating their recorded skill sets regularly. These updates should
                        occur at least as frequently as employees' regular line manager reviews, and certainly when
                        their skill sets have changed.

                        Outdoor education usually refers to organized learning that takes place in the outdoors. Outdoor
                        education programs sometimes involve residential or journey-based experiences in which students
                        participate in a variety of adventurous challenges in the form of outdoor activities such as
                        hiking, climbing, canoeing, ropes courses, and group games. Outdoor education draws upon the
                        philosophy, theory, and practices of experiential education and environmental education.

                        Outdoor education can be simply defined as experiential learning in, for, or about the outdoors.
                        The term ‘outdoor education’, however, is used quite broadly to refer to a range of organized
                        activities which take place in a variety of ways in predominantly outdoor environments. Common
                        definitions of outdoor education are difficult to achieve because interpretations vary according
                        to culture, philosophy, and local conditions.

                        Outdoor education is often referred to as synonymous with adventure education, adventure
                        programming, and outdoor learning, outdoor school, adventure therapy, adventure recreation,
                        adventure tourism, expeditionary learning, challenge education, experiential education,
                        environmental education, Forest schools and wilderness education.

                        Consensus about the meaning of these terms are also difficult to achieve. However, outdoor
                        education often uses or draws upon these related elements and/or informs these areas. The
                        hallmark of outdoor education is its focus on the "outdoor" side of this education; whereas
                        adventure education would focus on the adventure side and environmental education would focus on
                        environmental.

                        Some typical aims of outdoor education are to:

                        learn how to overcome adversity
                        enhance personal and social development
                        develop a deeper relationship with nature.
                        Outdoor education spans the three domains of self, others, and the natural world. The relative
                        emphasis of these three domains varies from one program to another. An outdoor education program
                        can, for example, emphasize one (or more) of these aims to:

                        teach outdoor survival skills
                        improve problem solving skills
                        reduce recidivism
                        enhance teamwork
                        develop leadership skills
                        understand natural environments
                        promote spirituality

                    <h3 class="page-header">Moral Education</h3>
                    <div>

                        Morality (from the Latin moralities "manner, character, proper behavior") is a system of conduct
                        and ethics that is virtuous. Morality has three principal meanings.
                        In its "descriptive" sense, morality refers to personal or cultural values, codes of conduct or
                        social mores that distinguish between right and wrong in the human society. Describing morality
                        in this way is not making a claim about what is objectively right or wrong, but only referring
                        to what is considered right or wrong by people. For the most part right and wrong acts are
                        classified as such because they are thought to cause benefit or harm, but it is possible that
                        many moral beliefs are based on prejudice, ignorance or even hatred. This sense of term is also
                        addressed by descriptive ethics.

                        In its "normative" sense, morality refers directly to what is right and wrong, regardless of
                        what people think. It could be defined as the conduct of the ideal "moral" person in a certain
                        situation. This usage of the term is characterized by "definitive" statements such as "That act
                        is immoral" rather than descriptive ones such as "Many believe that act is immoral." It is often
                        challenged by a moral skepticism, in which the unchanging existence of a rigid, universal,
                        objective moral "truth" is rejected, and supported by moral realism, in which the existence of
                        this "truth" is accepted. The normative usage of the term "morality" is also addressed by
                        normative ethics.

                        Morality may also be defined as synonymous with ethics, the field that encompasses the above two
                        meanings and others within a systematic philosophical study of the moral domain. Ethics seeks to
                        address questions such as how a moral outcome can be achieved in a specific situation (applied
                        ethics), how moral values should be determined (normative ethics), what morals people actually
                        abide by (descriptive ethics), what the fundamental nature of ethics or morality is, including
                        whether it has any objective justification (meta-ethics), and how moral capacity or moral agency
                        develops and what its nature is (moral psychology).

                        A key issue is the meaning of the terms "moral" or "immoral". Moral realism would hold that
                        there are true moral statements which report objective moral facts, whereas moral anti-realism
                        would hold that morality is derived from any one of the norms prevalent in society (cultural
                        relativism); the edicts of a god (divine command theory); is merely an expression of the
                        speakers' sentiments (emotivism); an implied imperative (universal prescriptivism); or falsely
                        presupposes that there are objective moral facts (error theory). Some thinkers hold that there
                        is no correct definition of right behavior, that morality can only be judged with respect to
                        particular situations, within the standards of particular belief systems and socio-historical
                        contexts. This position, known as moral relativism, often cites empirical evidence from
                        anthropology as evidence to support its claims. The opposite view, that there are universal,
                        eternal moral truths are known as moral universalism. Moral universalists might concede that
                        forces of social conformity significantly shape moral decisions, but deny that cultural norms
                        and customs define morally right behavior.
