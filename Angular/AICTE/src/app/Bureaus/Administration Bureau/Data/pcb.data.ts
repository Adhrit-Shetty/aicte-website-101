           <p><b>Planning</b> in organizations and public policy is both the organizational process of creating and
                        maintaining a plan; and the psychological process of thinking about the activities required to
                        create a desired goal on some scale. As such, it is a fundamental property of intelligent
                        behavior. This thought process is essential to the creation and refinement of a plan, or
                        integration of it with other plans, that is, it combines forecasting of developments with the
                        preparation of scenarios of how to react to them.</p>

                        <p>The term is also used to describe the formal procedures used in such an endeavor, such as the
                        creation of documents diagrams, or meetings to discuss the important issues to be addressed, the
                        objectives to be met, and the strategy to be followed. Beyond this, planning has a different
                            meaning depending on the political or economic context in which it is used.</p>

                        <p>Two attitudes to planning need to be held in tension: on the one hand we need to be prepared for
                        what may lie ahead, which may mean contingencies and flexible processes. On the other hand, our
                            future is shaped by consequences of our own planning and actions.</p>

                        <p><b>Coordination</b> is the act of coordinating, making different people or things work together for a
                            goal or effect.</p>

        body: `<p>The India Technical Education is on a growth path with more than 12000 institutions. The
                        investment made in higher education in the 1950s and 1960s has given us a strong knowledge Base
                        in many fields and contributed significantly to economic development, social progress, and
                            political democracy in independent India.</p>

                        <p>At the time of independence, the number of universities was no more than 22 Eleventh Five Year
                        Plan 20, of colleges around 500 and the total enrolment was less than 1.0 lakh. By the end of
                        the Tenth Plan, the Indian higher education system has grown into one of the largest in the
                        world with 378 universities, 18064 colleges, a faculty strength of 4.92 lakh, and an estimated
                            enrolment of 140 lakh students.</p>

                        <p>The higher education institutions include 23 Central universities (CU), 216 State universities,
                        110 deemed universities, 11 private universities, and 33 institutions of national importance
                        established through central legislation and another 5 institutions established through State
                            legislations.</p>

                        <p>Despite the expansion that has occurred, it is evident that the system is under stress to
                        provide a sufficient volume of skilled human power, which is equipped with the required
                        knowledge and technical skills to cater to the demands of the economy. The accelerated growth of
                        our economy has already created shortages of high-quality technical manpower. Unlike the
                        developed countries, where the young working age population is fast shrinking with higher
                        dependency ratios, India has a demographic advantage with about 70% of the population below the
                        age of 35 years. But this advantage can only be realised if we expand opportunities for our
                        youth on a massive scale and in diverse fields of basic science, engineering and technology,
                        health care, architecture, management, etc. This is possible only if we initiate rapid expansion
                            along with long overdue reforms in the higher, technical, and professional education sectors.</p>

                        <p>Expansion, inclusion, and rapid improvement in quality throughout the higher and technical
                        education system by enhancing public spending, encouraging private initiatives, and initiating
                        the long overdue major institutional and policy reforms will form the core of the Eleventh Plan
                        effort. Our long-term goal is to set India as a nation in which all those who aspire good
                            quality higher education can access it, irrespective of their paying capacity.</p>`
