                                The AICTE was constituted in 1945 as an advisory body in all matters relating to
                                technical education. Even though it had no statutory powers, it played a very important
                                role in the development of technical education in the country. It had four regional
                                committees with offices at Chennai, Mumbai, Kanpur and Calcutta. All the new schemes and
                                proposals for starting new institutions/Programmes were approved by the corresponding
                                Regional Committee and subsequently vetted by the Council.

                                There was large-scale expansion of technical education in the late fifties and early
                                sixties and again in the eighties. While the expansion in the fifties was done with the
                                approval of the AICTE and the Government of India, the expansion in the eighties was
                                localised mostly in the four states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra
                                Pradesh and was primarily in the self-financing sector without the approval of the AICTE
                                and Government of India. It was in this period that the National Policy on
                                Education-1986 made a specific mention of the need to make AICTE a statutory body and
                                stated:
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Even earlier, the Education Commission of 1964. popularly known as Kothari Commission
                                after the name of its Chairman, made the following recommendation for the proper
                                administration of technical education:
                                <i>"To ensure the pursuit of the highest standards at the first degree and post-graduate
                                    levels, and to provide on adequate machinery with the national and professional
                                    concern
                                    with the future development at these levels, we have recommended the setting up of a
                                    UGC-type organisation, industry and concerned Ministries. This body should have a
                                    full-time chairman, and funds should be allotted to it on a block basis."</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In view of the above, AICTE became a statutory body through an Act of Parliament 52, in
                                1987. The Council, i.e. AICTE was established with a view to the proper planning and
                                co-ordinated development of the technical education system throughout the country, the
                                promotion of qualitative improvement of such education in relation to planned
                                quantitative grow is-flexth and the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and
                                standards in
                                the technical education system for matters connected therewith. Technical education was
                                defined as programmes of education, research and training in engineering, technology,
                                architecture, town planning, management, pharmacy and applied arts and crafts and such
                                other programmes or areas as the Central Government may, in consultation with the
                                Council, by notification in the official Gazette, declare. The Act also laid down the
                                powers, functions and structure of the AICTE.
                            </li>

                                Having vested with Statutory powers, AICTE has initiated necessary steps for planning,
                                formulation and maintenance of norms and standards, accreditation, funding of priority
                                areas, monitoring and evaluation of courses/programmes in the field of technical
                                education to ensure coordinated and integrated development of technical education in the
                                Country. In order to achieve the planned grow is-flexth and to nurture quality in
                                technical
                                education system, AICTE has spared no effort to inculcate competitiveness to face the
                                globalization and in generating competence and quality in technically qualified human

              The AICTE was constituted in 1945 as an advisory body in all matters relating to
              technical
              education. Even though it had no statutory powers, it played a very important role in
              the
              development of technical education in the country. It had four regional committees with
              offices
              at Chennai, Mumbai, Kanpur and Calcutta. All the new schemes and proposals for starting
              new
              institutions/ Programmes were approved by the corresponding Regional Committee and
              subsequently
              vetted by the Council.
            </li>
            <li>There was large-scale expansion of technical education in the late fifties and early
              sixties and
              again in the eighties. While the expansion in the fifties was done with the approval of
              the
              AICTE and the Government of India, the expansion in the eighties was localised mostly in
              the
              four states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and was primarily
              in the
              self-financing sector without the approval of the AICTE and...

            <p>
               Delegation (or deputation) is the assignment of authority and responsibility to another
               person
               (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. However the
               person
               who delegated the work remains accountable for the outcome of the delegated work.
            </p>
            <p>
               Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions, i.e. it is a shift of decision-making
               authority from one organizational level to a lower one. Delegation, if properly done, is not
               abdication. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager
               provides
               too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. In general, delegation is good and
               can
               save money and time, help in building skills, and motivate people. Poor delegation, on the
               other
               hand, might cause frustration, and confusion to all the involved parties.
            </p>
            <p>
               In most polities, the most prominent form of delegation is from lawmakers (e.g.,
               parliaments) to
               government agencies (e.g., economic, security, and public welfare agencies). Such agencies
               house
               the persons responsible for enforcing laws and tend to employ the nation’s leading experts
               in
               the agency’s policy area (e.g., economic agencies employ leading economists). In many
               places,
               these agencies are known collectively as the bureaucracy. In some places, people who work
               within
               these agencies are called bureaucrats or civil servants.
