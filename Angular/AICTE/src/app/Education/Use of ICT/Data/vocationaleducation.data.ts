          Vocational education or Vocational Education and Training (VET), also called Career and
                        Technical Education (CTE), prepares learners for jobs that are based in manual or practical
                        activities, traditionally non-academic and totally related to a specific trade, occupation or
                        vocation, hence the term, in which the learner participates. It is sometimes referred to as
                        technical education, as the learner directly develops expertise in a particular group of
                        techniques or technology.
                        Generally, vocation and career are used interchangeably. Vocational education might be
                        classified as teaching procedural knowledge. This may be contrasted with declarative knowledge,
                        as used in education in a usually broader scientific field, which might concentrate on theory
                        and abstract conceptual knowledge, characteristic of tertiary education.

                        Vocational education can be at the secondary or post-secondary level and can interact with the
                        apprenticeship system. Increasingly, vocational education can be recognised in terms of
                        recognition of prior learning and partial academic credit towards tertiary education (e.g., at a
                        university) as credit; however, it is rarely considered in its own form to fall under the
                        traditional definition of a higher education.

                        Up until the end of the twentieth century, vocational education focused on specific trades such
                        as for example, an automobile mechanic or welder, and was therefore associated with the
                        activities of lower social classes. As a consequence, it attracted a level of stigma. Vocational
                        education is related to the age-old apprenticeship system of learning.

                        However, as the labor market becomes more specialized and economies demand higher levels of
                        skill, governments and businesses are increasingly investing in the future of vocational
                        education through publicly funded training organizations and subsidized apprenticeship or
                        traineeship initiatives for businesses. At the post-secondary level vocational education is
                        typically provided by an institute of technology, or by a local community college.
