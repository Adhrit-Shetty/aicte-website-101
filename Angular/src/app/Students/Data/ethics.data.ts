        body: ` <h3>Values</h3>
                            <p>Values are the rules by which we make decisions about right and wrong, should and shouldn't,
                            good and bad. They also tell us which are more or less important, which is useful when we
                            have
                                to trade off meeting one value over another.</p>

                            <h3>Dictionary defines values as:</h3>
                            <p>Beliefs of a person or social group in which they have an emotional investment (either for
                            or
                                against something); "he has very conservatives values"</p>

                            <h3>Morals</h3>
                            <p>Morals have a greater social element to values and tend to have a very broad acceptance.
                            Morals
                            are far more about good and bad than other values. We thus judge others more strongly on
                            morals
                            than values. A person can be described as immoral, yet there is no word for them not
                            following
                                values.</p>

                            <h3>Dictionary defines morals as:</h3>
                            <p>Motivation based on ideas of right and wrong</p>

                            <h3>Ethics</h3>
                            <p>You can have professional ethics, but you seldom hear about professional morals. Ethics tend
                            to
                            be codified into a formal system or set of rules which are explicitly adopted by a group of
                            people. Thus you have medical ethics. Ethics are thus internally defined and adopted, whilst
                                morals tend to be externally imposed on other people.</p>

                            <p>If you accuse someone of being unethical, it is equivalent of calling them unprofessional
                            and
                            may well be taken as a significant insult and perceived more personally than if you called
                            them
                                immoral (which of course they may also not like).</p>

                            <h3>Dictionary defines ethics as:</h3>
                            <p>A theory or a system of moral values: â€œAn ethic of service is at war with a craving for
                            gain".
                                The rules or standards governing the conduct of a person or the members of a profession.</p>

                            <p>Ethics of principled conviction asserts that intent is the most important factor. If you
                            have
                                good principles, then you will act ethically.</p>

                            <p>Ethics of responsibility challenges this, saying that you must understand the consequences
                            of
                            your decisions and actions and answer to these, not just your high-minded principles. The
                            medical maxim 'do no harm', for example, is based in the outcome-oriented ethics of
                                responsibility.</p>
                            <p>Ethics and morals must be known to be followed.</p>
