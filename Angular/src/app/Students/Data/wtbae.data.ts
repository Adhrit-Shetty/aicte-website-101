                <p>An entrepreneur is a person who has possession of a new enterprise, venture or idea and is
                            accountable for the inherent
                        risks and the outcome. The term was originally a loanword from French and was first defined by
                        the Irish-French economist
                            Richard Cantillon. Entrepreneur in English is a term applied to a person who is willing to
                        launch a new venture or enterprise
                        and accept full responsibility for the outcome. Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist, is
                        believed to have coined the word
                        "entrepreneur" in the 19th century - he defined an entrepreneur as "one who undertakes an
                        enterprise, especially a
                        contractor, acting as intermediatory between capital and labour". A broader definition by French
                        Economist J.B. Say (1800)
                        "The entrepreneur shifts economic resources out of lower and into higher productivity and
                            greater yield.</p>
