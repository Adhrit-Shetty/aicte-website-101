                        India is one of the most populated countries in the world, second after China. With a workforce
                        of more than 440 million, a huge pool of English-speaking graduates and a fast-growing economy,
                        the need for employment opportunities has increased drastically. The Government is doing its
                        best to bring about a better matching between the demand and the supply of work opportunities.
                        The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) (External website that opens in a new window)
                        and the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) (External website that opens in a new window) conduct
                        competitive exams for recruitment to various services and posts. The Government has also set up
                        a number of Employment Exchanges all over the country to facilitate recruitment of suitable
                        candidates into its various sectors.
