                            <h3>Providing Access to Differently-abled persons</h3>
                        <p>It has been felt that differently-abled persons need special arrangements in the environment for
                        their mobility and independent functioning. It is also a fact that many institutes have
                        architectural barriers that disabled persons find difficult for their day-today functioning. The
                        colleges are expected to address accessibility related issues as per the stipulations of the
                        Persons with Disabilities Act 1995, and ensure that all existing structures as well as future
                        construction projects in their campuses are made disabled friendly. The institutes should create
                        special facilities such as ramps, rails and special toilets, and make other necessary changes to
                        suit the special needs of differently-abled persons. The construction plans should clearly
                        address the accessibility issues pertaining to disability. Guidelines on accessibility laid out
                            by the office of the Chief Commissioner of Disabilities.</p>

                            <h3>Providing Special Equipment to augment Educational Services for Differently abled Persons</h3>

                        <p>Differently-abled persons require special aids and appliances for their daily functioning. These
                        aids are available through various schemes of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. In
                        addition to the procurement of assistive devices through these schemes, the higher education
                        institute may also need special learning and assessment devices to help differently-abled
                        students enrolled for higher education. In addition, visually challenged students need Readers.
                        Availability of devices such as computers with screen reading software, low-vision aids,
                        scanners, mobility devices, etc., in the institutes would enrich the educational experiences of
                        differently-abled persons. Therefore, colleges are encouraged to procure such devices and
                            provide facility of Readers for visually challenged students.</p>
