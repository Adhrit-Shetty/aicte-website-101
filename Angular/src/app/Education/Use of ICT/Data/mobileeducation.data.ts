        body: `The term mLearning, or "mobile learning", has different meanings for different communities.
                            Although related to e-learning and distance education, it is distinct in its focus on learning
                            across contexts and learning with mobile devices.
                            One definition of mobile learning is: Any sort of learning that happens when the learner is not
                            at a fixed, predetermined location, or learning that happens when the learner takes advantage of
                            the learning opportunities offered by mobile technologies. In other words mobile learning
                            decreases limitation of learning location with the mobility of general portable devices.

                            The term covers: learning with portable technologies, where the focus is on the technology
                            (which could be in a fixed location, such as a classroom); learning across contexts, where the
                            focus is on the mobility of the learner, interacting with portable or fixed technology and
                            learning in a mobile society, with a focus on how society and its institutions can accommodate
                            and support the learning of an increasingly mobile population that is not satisfied with
                            existing learning methodologies.

                            M-learning is convenient in the sense that it is accessible from virtually anywhere, which
                            provides access to all the different learning materials available. It is also collaborative;
                            sharing is almost instantaneous among everyone using the same content, which leads to the
                            reception of instant feedback and tips. M-Learning also brings strong portability by replacing
                            books and notes with small RAMs, filled with tailored learning contents. In addition, this kind
                            of learning is engaging and fun. Therefore, it is simple to utilize mobile learning for a more
                            effective and entertaining experience.`

        header: 'Blended Learning',
        body: `Blended Learning refers to a mixing of different learning environments. The phrase has many
                            specific meanings based upon the context in which it is used. Blended learning gives learners
                            and teachers a potential environment to learn and teach more effectively.

                            Whether a course should be proposed as a face-to-face interaction, an online course or a blended
                            course depends on the analysis of the competences at stake, the nature and location of the
                            audience, and the resources available. Depending on the cross-analysis of these 3 parameters,
                            the course designer will opt for one of the 3 options. In his course scenario he/she will then
                            have to decide which parts are online, which parts are offline. A basic example of this is a
                            course of English as a second language where the instructor reaches the conclusion that all
                            audio-based activities (listening comprehension, oral expression) will take place in the
                            classroom where all text-based activities will take place online (reading comprehension, essays
                            writing).

                            BLENDED learning increases the options for greater quality and quantity of human interaction in
                            a learning environment. Blended learning offers learners the opportunity “to be both together
                            and apart.” A community of learners can interact at any time and anywhere because of the
                            benefits that computer-mediated educational tools provide. Blended learning provides a ‘good’
                            mix of technologies and interactions, resulting in a socially supported, constructive, learning
                            experience; this is especially significant given the profound effect that it could have on
                            distance learning.

                            Role of the instructor
                            The instructor can combine two or more methods of teaching method. A typical example of blended
                            learning methodology would be a combination of technology-based materials and face-to-face
                            sessions to present content.

                            An instructor can begin a course with a well-structured introductory lesson in the classroom,
                            and then proceed with follow-up materials online. Blended learning can also be applied to the
                            integration of e-learning with a Learning Management System using computers in a physical
                            classroom, along with face-to-face instruction. Guidance is suggested early in the process, to
                            be used more sparingly as learners gain expertise.

                            The role of the instructor is critical as this requires a transformation process to that of
                            learning facilitator. Quite often, with the increase of baby boomers going back to school and
                            pursuing higher education the skills required for technology use are limited. Instructors then
                            find themselves more in the role of assisting students with computer skills and applications,
                            helping them access the internet, and encouraging them to be independent learners. Blended
                            learning takes time for both the instructor and learner to adapt to this relatively new
                            instructional concept.

           Outdoor education usually refers to organized learning that takes place in the outdoors. Outdoor
                            education programs sometimes involve residential or journey-based experiences in which students
                            participate in a variety of adventurous challenges in the form of outdoor activities such as
                            hiking, climbing, canoeing, ropes courses, and group games. Outdoor education draws upon the
                            philosophy, theory, and practices of experiential education and environmental education.

                            Outdoor education can be simply defined as experiential learning in, for, or about the outdoors.
                            The term ‘outdoor education’, however, is used quite broadly to refer to a range of organized
                            activities which take place in a variety of ways in predominantly outdoor environments. Common
                            definitions of outdoor education are difficult to achieve because interpretations vary according
                            to culture, philosophy, and local conditions.

                            Outdoor education is often referred to as synonymous with adventure education, adventure
                            programming, and outdoor learning, outdoor school, adventure therapy, adventure recreation,
                            adventure tourism, expeditionary learning, challenge education, experiential education,
                            environmental education, Forest schools and wilderness education.

                            Consensus about the meaning of these terms are also difficult to achieve. However, outdoor
                            education often uses or draws upon these related elements and/or informs these areas. The
                            hallmark of outdoor education is its focus on the "outdoor" side of this education; whereas
                            adventure education would focus on the adventure side and environmental education would focus on
                            environmental.

                            Some typical aims of outdoor education are to:

                            learn how to overcome adversity
                            enhance personal and social development
                            develop a deeper relationship with nature.
                            Outdoor education spans the three domains of self, others, and the natural world. The relative
                            emphasis of these three domains varies from one program to another. An outdoor education program
                            can, for example, emphasize one (or more) of these aims to:

                            teach outdoor survival skills
                            improve problem solving skills
                            reduce recidivism
                            enhance teamwork
                            develop leadership skills
                            understand natural environments
                            promote spirituality
