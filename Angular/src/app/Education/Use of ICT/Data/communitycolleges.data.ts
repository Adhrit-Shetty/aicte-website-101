           <p>India is a vast country with a population of more than 1.2 billion. 75% of Indiaâ€™s population
                        lives in about six lac villages. There is a visible difference in rural and urban, rich and
                        poor, highly educated and lesser educated, forward and backward areas. While resourceful people,
                        particularly those living in urban areas, have had access to better education and professional
                        training, but vast majority of those who live in rural areas and slums are lesser educated and
                        hardly undergo any technical, professional and vocational training. In fact, for most of such
                            people, quality education and higher technical and professional education is unaffordable.</p>

                        <p>In terms of career options, such lesser educated and not so fortunate people tend to work in low
                        paid unorganized sector. Per person productivity of such persons works out to be a small
                        fraction of productivity of those who work in organized sector of Indian economy. In an
                        increasingly competitive economic environment of our country, the unorganized sector, which is
                        so important for the country, needs to increase the productivity of its manpower for its
                            survival and growth.</p>

                        <p>Yet another paradox before the Indian informal sector is that it can not afford employing highly
                        educated and professionally trained manpower which usually aspires for highly challenging,
                        rewarding and satisfying career. The only option available before the Indian informal sector is
                        to depend upon relatively low paid manpower trained through nonformal system of skill
                            development.</p>

                        <p>There is, therefore, an urgent need to train millions of persons every year through a
                        countrywide network of non-formal skill development. Such non-formal skill training should
                            attract beneficiaries from all cross-sections of Indian society.</p>

                        <p>There are more than 3200 polytechnics and equivalent technical institutions which exhibit
                        potential to provide skill training to millions of youth through their own facilities and or by
                        establishing extension centres in collaboration with ITIs, or Vocational Skill Knowledge
                        providers, NGOs. These polytechnics can also render useful services in adoption of appropriate
                            technologies and providing technical and support services to rural people and slum dwellers.</p>



                        <p>AICTE approved polytechnics are considered to be a viable vehicle for providing the intended
                            services as mentioned above.</p>
