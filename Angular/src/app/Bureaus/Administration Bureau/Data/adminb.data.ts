        <p>In business, administration consists of the performance or management of business
                                operations
                                and thus the making or implementing of major decisions. Administration can be defined as
                                the
                                universal process of organizing people and resources efficiently so as to direct
                                activities
                                toward common goals and objectives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The word is derived from the Middle English word administracioun, which is in turn
                                derived
                                from the French administration, itself derived from the Latin administratio â€” a
                                compounding
                                of ad ("to") and ministratio ("give service").
