              The AICTE was constituted in 1945 as an advisory body in all matters relating to
              technical education. Even though it had no statutory powers, it played a very important
              role in the development of technical education in the country. It had four regional
              committees with offices at Chennai, Mumbai, Kanpur and Calcutta. All the new schemes and
              proposals for starting new institutions/Programmes were approved by the corresponding
              Regional Committee and subsequently vetted by the Council.
            </li>
            <li>
              There was large-scale expansion of technical education in the late fifties and early
              sixties and again in the eighties. While the expansion in the fifties was done with the
              approval of the AICTE and the Government of India, the expansion in the eighties was
              localised mostly in the four states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra
              Pradesh and was primarily in the self-financing sector without the approval of the AICTE
              and Government of India. It was in this period that the National Policy on
              Education-1986 made a specific mention of the need to make AICTE a statutory body and
              stated:
            </li>
            <li>
              Even earlier, the Education Commission of 1964. popularly known as Kothari Commission
              after the name of its Chairman, made the following recommendation for the proper
              administration of technical education:
              <i>"To ensure the pursuit of the highest standards at the first degree and post-graduate
                levels, and to provide on adequate machinery with the national and professional
                concern
                with the future development at these levels, we have recommended the setting up of a
                UGC-type organisation, industry and concerned Ministries. This body should have a
                full-time chairman, and funds should be allotted to it on a block basis."</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              In view of the above, AICTE became a statutory body through an Act of Parliament 52, in
              1987. The Council, i.e. AICTE was established with a view to the proper planning and
              co-ordinated development of the technical education system throughout the country, the
              promotion of qualitative improvement of such education in relation to planned
              quantitative grow is-flexth and the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and
              standards in
              the technical education system for matters connected therewith. Technical education was
              defined as programmes of education, research and training in engineering, technology,
              architecture, town planning, management, pharmacy and applied arts and crafts and such
              other programmes or areas as the Central Government may, in consultation with the
              Council, by notification in the official Gazette, declare. The Act also laid down the
              powers, functions and structure of the AICTE.
            </li>
            <li>
              Having vested with Statutory powers, AICTE has initiated necessary steps for planning,
              formulation and maintenance of norms and standards, accreditation, funding of priority
              areas, monitoring and evaluation of courses/programmes in the field of technical
              education to ensure coordinated and integrated development of technical education in the
              Country. In order to achieve the planned grow is-flexth and to nurture quality in
              technical
              education system, AICTE has spared no effort to inculcate competitiveness to face the
              globalization and in generating competence and quality in technically qualified human
              resources to make it globally acceptable.
