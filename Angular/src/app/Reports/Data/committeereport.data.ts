            <h3>Yashpal Committee Report
                        </h3>
                        <p>A university is a place where new ideas germinate, strike roots and grow tall and sturdy. It is
                        a unique space, which covers the entire universe of knowledge. It is a place where creative
                        minds converge, interact with each other and construct visions of new realities. Established
                            notions of truth are challenged in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>To be able to do all this, universities have to be autonomous spaces. They are diverse in their
                        design and organization, reflecting the unique historical and socio-cultural settings in which
                        they have grown. This diversity reflects the organic links that they have with their
                        surroundings, which are not only physical but cultural as well. Through research and teaching,
                        they create, evaluate and bring about advances in knowledge and culture. The principle of moral
                        and intellectual autonomy from political authority and economic power is ingrained in the very
                        idea of the university. This autonomy ensures freedom in research and training and it is
                        expected that the governments and the society would respect this fundamental principle. Teaching
                        and research have to be inseparable, because the task of the university is not only to impart
                        knowledge to young people but also to give them opportunities to create their own knowledge.
                        Active and constant engagement with the young minds and hearts of the society also implies that
                        the universities are to serve the society as a whole, and in order to achieve this, considerable
                            investment in continuing education is essential.</p>
                        <p>The slow but increasing democratization of higher education in India has meant that the
                        university is no longer the preserve of the children of the elite, or of the educated /
                        professional middle-class. As more youngsters from a different segment of society enter the
                        universities, they look at higher education as a means to transcend the class barriers.
                        Consequently, university education is no longer viewed as a good in itself, but also as the
                        stepping-stone into a higher orbit of the job market, where the student expects a concrete
                        monetary return, and consequently in this perception, the university of today is expected to be
                        in tune with the emerging needs of the society. Even so, graduates should be sufficiently
                        exposed to interdisciplinary experiences, which can sustain them when the demands of a
                            particular job market changes.</p><br>
