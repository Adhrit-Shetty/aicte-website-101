             <p>Knowledge has been recognised as the key driving force in the 21st century and India’s ability
                            to emerge as a globally competitive player will substantially depend on its knowledge resources.
                            To foster generational change, a systemic transformation is required that seeks to address the
                            concerns of the entire knowledge spectrum. This massive endeavour involves creating a roadmap
                            for reform of the knowledge sector that focuses on enhancing access to knowledge, fundamentally
                            improving education systems and their delivery, re-shaping the research, development and
                            innovation structures, and harnessing knowledge applications for generating better services.
                            Such a knowledge revolution that seeks to build capacity and generate quality will enable our
                            country to empower its human capital – including the 550 million below the age of 25. Our unique
                            demographic dividend offers a tremendous opportunity as well as a daunting challenge which
                                requires creative strategies for a new knowledge oriented paradigm.</p>

                            <p>Keeping this scenario in mind, the National Knowledge Commission (NKC) was constituted in June
                            2005 by the Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Sam Pitroda, to
                            prepare a blueprint for reform of our knowledge related institutions and infrastructure which
                                would enable India to meet the challenges of the future. The Terms of Reference of NKC are:</p>

<ul type="disc">
                            <li>Build excellence in the educational system to meet the knowledge challenges of the 21st century
                                and increase India’s competitive advantage in fields of knowledge.</li>
    <li>Promote creation of knowledge in Science & Technology laboratories.</li>
    <li>Improve the management of institutions engaged in Intellectual Property Rights.</li>
    <li>Promote knowledge applications in Agriculture and Industry.</li>
                            <li>Promote the use of knowledge capabilities in making government an effective, transparent and
                                accountable service provider to the citizen and promote widespread sharing</li></ul>
